This program tests the disassembly of every single xtensa instruction
and matches the disassembled output to the source file.

In order to generate the binary, the ESP32 xtensa toolchain needs to be in
your path.

The toolchain can be found at:
- Linux (also works on WSL) https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz
- Windows (you will also need MSYS2) https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-win32-1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0.zip
- Mac OS https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-osx-1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0.tar.gz
